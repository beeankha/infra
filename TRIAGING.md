## The Triaging Process at `conda`

"Triaging" refers to the process of assessing the priority of incoming issues.

In order to explain how various `conda` issues are evaluated, the following document will provide information about our triaging process in the form of an FAQ.


### Why triage?

At the most basic "bird's eye view" level, triaged issues will fall into the category of three main priority levels:

- Do now
- Do sometime
- Never do (_i.e._, close)

At its core, triaging enables new issues to be sorted into these three categories, which enables them to be processed at a velocity similar to or exceeding the rate at which new issues are coming in. One of the benefits of actively triaging issues is to avoid burnout and make necessary work sustainable; this is done by eliminating a never-ending backlog that has not been reviewed by any maintainers.

There will always be broad-scope design and architecture implementations that the `conda` team will be interested in pursuing that are not necessarily community inspired; triaging helps the maintainers to track and tackle both specific and big-picture goals


### How do items show up in triaging?

New issues that are opened in any of the repositories in the [`conda` GitHub project](https://github.com/conda) will show up in the `New` column of the [Triaging board](https://github.com/orgs/conda/projects/4).


### What is done about the issues in "triaging" mode?

Issues in the "Triaging" column of the board are considered ready for the following procedures:

- Mitigation via short-term workarounds and fixes
- Redirection to the correct project
- Determining if support can be provided for errors and questions
- Closing out of any duplicate issues

The engineer/maintainer who is assigned to the triaging rotation is not seeking to _resolve_ issues that arise. Instead, the goal is to understand the issue and to collect enough details from the user in order to reproduce the errors or to otherwise assess the scope of the issue at hand.


### When do items move out of triaging?

[TODO]


### Where do items go after being triaged?

[TODO]


### What is the purpose of having a "backlog"?

Backlogged/Milestoned
If milestoned remove [backlog]
If unmilestoned add [backlog]
If labeled as [backlog] remove milestone


### What is the purpose of a "development sprint"?

[TODO]


### How does labeling work?
